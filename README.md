In my personal project, I have developed a full-stack web application leveraging the Spring Boot framework with a microservices architecture for backend implementation. The frontend is built using React.js, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience. The application follows industry best practices, incorporating RESTful API design, Spring Cloud components, and event-driven communication where applicable. Additionally, it integrates JWT-based authentication, database management using JPA/Hibernate, and Dockerized deployment for scalability. Let me know if you need further refinements!
